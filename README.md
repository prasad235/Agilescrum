# Agilescrum

velocity

average of story points in the last 3 months

1. product backlog - 200 pts
2. how to point mapping - 1 pointer reference story= 10 hrs
3. team capacity (best case hours, worst case)- 2 weeks capacity
4. calculation = best-case velocity (hours, hrs/point = estimated velocity)
5. estimated velocity should always present in the range.

how to find sprint cost before the project start?

employee cost to company = 100000
365 days in total there are 104 weekends, 10 holidays, 28 paid leaves, overall there are approximately 223 working days
Total hours = 223*8 =1784 hrs
cost to company  = 100000/1784 = $56/hr + margin

Team velocity (best case) = 6 story point
Team members = 4
Loaded Team cost = 4 * 56 =224
(assume all 4 members have same cost)
Team cost per sprint = 224 * 80 *2 = $35840 ( 80 hours for 2 week sprint)
                                   =$35000 ( approx round off)
